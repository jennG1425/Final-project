# Optional_Part
Here we have a code to obtain the five invariants and the ten combinations of tensors.
We make the tensors using the data obtained for the Moser flow. But the necessary data is from the rans simualtions, where the outputs are the turbulent kinetic 
energy (tke), the energy disspation (epsilon), the velocity gradients (grad_u_ij) and the Reynols stresses components are obtained from DNS (uu_ij).
